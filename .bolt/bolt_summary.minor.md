Our conversation has centered on the development of a TypeScript monorepo for an agentic AI workflow builder, specifically focusing on the web/ UI application and the packages/ninja-agents/ SDK. The overarching goal is to streamline the process from brainstorming to visualizing and deploying AI agents.

Significant progress has been made in implementing interactive demonstrations within the web/ application. We've set up a "Single Shinobi Demo" showcasing a Research Director agent with various skills and tools, a "Clan Demo" illustrating multi-agent collaboration (Research Director, Technical Analyst, Business Analyst), and a "Dojo Demo" for structured sequential workflows. These demos leverage newly defined Shinobi, Kata, and Shuriken configurations, along with dedicated API routes for orchestration.

A major focus has also been on comprehensive documentation updates for the ninja-agents SDK. This includes detailing recent changes, providing installation and usage instructions, outlining advanced configurations, and offering guidance on best practices for performance, security, and integration. The documentation now covers a wide array of topics, from core component definitions to troubleshooting, ensuring clarity and consistency across the project.
