Overall App Idea
The project aims to build a modular, full-stack agentic AI workflow builder. The core idea is to transform user brainstorming sessions (via voice or chat) into visual, composable, and deployable AI agents. This involves a UI application for interaction and a powerful backend package for AI orchestration.

Project Structure
The project is organized as a monorepo with two main parts:

web/ (UI App): This is the frontend application responsible for brainstorming, visualizing, editing (via a drag-and-drop interface), and deploying AI agents. It provides the user-facing interactive chat interface and will eventually support voice input.
packages/ninja-agents/ (Agent Engine): This is the core TypeScript package that powers the AI reasoning and orchestration. It defines the fundamental building blocks for creating sophisticated AI workflows.
Package Structure (packages/ninja-agents/)
The ninja-agents package is designed as a composable AI Agent Framework with a newly introduced layered architecture:

Ninja Layer (User-Facing API): This layer provides enhanced versions of core components (Shinobi, Kata, Shuriken) and introduces higher-level orchestration concepts like Clan (agent networks for coordinating multiple Shinobi) and Dojo (workflow orchestration with fluent APIs for complex, multi-step processes). This is the primary interface for users to build their AI agents.
Thought System (Internal Reasoning Engine): This layer contains advanced reasoning modules. Crucially, access to the Thought System is exclusively through the Ninja Layer components. This architectural decision ensures proper separation of concerns, security, and system integrity, preventing direct manipulation of internal reasoning processes.
Scroll Layer (LLM Provider Abstraction): This layer provides a unified interface for integrating with different Large Language Model (LLM) providers (e.g., OpenAI).
Core Utilities: This includes foundational components like KataRuntime (for dependency injection), Memory (for persistent storage and logging), and Logger.
How to Leverage the Package
Users primarily interact with the ninja-agents package through its Ninja Layer components:

You define Shuriken for atomic tools/capabilities (e.g., web search, calculations).
You create Kata for specialized skills or tasks, which can optionally integrate Thought System capabilities via their configuration (thoughtModule).
You build Shinobi as persona-driven agents that orchestrate Kata and can also integrate multiple Thought System modules (thoughtModules) for advanced reasoning.
For complex multi-agent workflows, you can use Clan to coordinate multiple Shinobi with different strategies (sequential, parallel, collaborative, competitive, conditional).
For multi-step, conditional workflows, Dojo provides a fluent API to chain Shinobi and Clan instances.
The underlying Thought System capabilities are seamlessly integrated into these Ninja Layer components through configuration, abstracting away the complexity of direct interaction.
Documentation Structure
The project emphasizes comprehensive documentation:

web/ App Documentation: The web/src/app/docs directory contains the documentation for the UI application, explaining its features and usage.
packages/ninja-agents/docs (API Documentation): This directory now hosts the automatically generated API documentation for the ninja-agents package. We've integrated TypeDoc to generate comprehensive API references directly from TSDoc comments in the source code. This includes details on classes, interfaces, methods, parameters, and examples.
Specific READMEs: Key architectural layers within packages/ninja-agents/src (e.g., src/ninja/README.md, src/thought/README.md) contain detailed explanations, including architectural requirements, security guidelines, and migration instructions (especially for the Thought System's restricted access).

Our conversation has focused on establishing and documenting the Thought Module Layer's exclusive availability for Ninja layers within the Ninja Agents SDK architecture. Here's what we've accomplished:

üéØ Main Objective
You requested explicit documentation clarifying that Thought Module Layer functionality is exclusively available for Ninja layers, eliminating the need for repeated mentions throughout the documentation.

üîß Key Implementations
1. TypeDoc Integration & Documentation Enhancement
Added TypeDoc configuration (typedoc.json) for automated API documentation generation
Enhanced package.json with documentation generation scripts
Updated web documentation to showcase TypeDoc integration
Added comprehensive TSDoc comments throughout core components
2. Dual-Layer Architecture Documentation
Main index.ts now clearly exports both Ninja Layer and Thought System with proper grouping
Enhanced core components (Kata, Shinobi, Shuriken) with detailed TSDoc documentation
Created complete Ninja Layer implementation with enhanced components that properly integrate Thought System
3. Comprehensive Thought System Restriction Documentation
üìã Created 5 key documentation files:

src/thought/README.md - Prominent architectural requirement notice with clear examples
src/thought/MIGRATION.md - Step-by-step migration guide from direct access to Ninja Layer
src/thought/SECURITY.md - Security model and violation prevention
src/ninja/README.md - Complete Ninja Layer usage guide
Enhanced main exports with proper architectural boundaries
4. Runtime Enforcement & Validation
Automatic access validation with clear error messages
Development warnings for improper usage patterns
Security boundary enforcement at the code level
üèóÔ∏è Architectural Clarification Achieved
‚úÖ Now Clearly Documented:

Exclusive Access: Thought System only accessible through Ninja Layer
Security Rationale: Why this restriction exists (security, architecture, abstraction)
Migration Path: How to convert from direct access to proper patterns
Runtime Enforcement: Automatic validation and error handling
‚úÖ Prominent Notices Added:

Warning banners in all Thought System documentation
Clear ‚úÖ/‚ùå examples showing correct vs incorrect usage
Technical justification for architectural decisions
Comprehensive migration support
üîë Key Outcomes
No More Repeated Mentions Needed - The restriction is now a documented architectural principle
Clear Migration Path - Users can easily convert existing code
Security Enforcement - Runtime validation prevents violations
Professional Documentation - TypeDoc integration provides comprehensive API docs
Architectural Integrity - Clear separation between layers is maintained
The Thought Module Layer restriction is now established as a fundamental architectural design choice rather than a limitation, with full justification, examples, and migration support provided.
